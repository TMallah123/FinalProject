    <h1>Jewish Food Influencers</h1>
    
     
 <p class = "indent"><b>Like many teenagers you could say I spend some time perusing social media. As a food loving Jew I sometimes come across other food loving Jews, interesting food trends, or even just Jewish chefs that I enjoy watching. It is interesting to see other Jews, American, not American, teen, and not teen, exploring the same foods I explore. It is cool to see them talking about the foods I'm interested in, and cooking foods I want to learn about.  Most of my social media feeds consist of food and marvel content. So, I enjoy finding someone that is just as passionate about food as I am and likes to talk about it. I have compiled a couple of the most interesting Jewish food creators I have come across.

        <p>Eitan Bernath</p>
<p class = "indent">The first food related creator I started following in 2019 was Eitan Bernath. At this point he was just a high school student making silly cooking videos, like trying celebrity recipes or weird food combos. Growing up he was on Chopped Junior and now he has been on multiple talk shows, has his own cookbook, and gained a large following on most social media platforms. I have even made a few of his recipes which all turned out pretty good. From a Jewish standpoint he caters to a wide variety of Jews, in videos about Judaism he talks about his own religious practices, Jewish practices as a whole and it is not the only topic of his content. Sometimes if he is making a food for a holiday he tells the story of the holiday and why Jews eat it. This really shows that his content is for everyone, and when he makes something Jewish it is informative and educational. When I first started watching his videos I was immediately interested because it felt like he was talking right at you and it was very engaging. Interestingly, when his videos began to get very popular he set up a kitchen and photography studio in his family's garage for his filming.  </p>

        <p>Jeremy Scheck</p>
<p class = "indent">The next blogger/content creator is Jeremy Scheck. I started following him when he was a college student at Cornell making cooking videos in his free time. He has since graduated with a double major in Spanish and Italian. He took many classes in food sciences and has continuously posted recipes on his blog and other social media accounts.  Similar to Eitan he makes cooking videos that are sometimes specifically Jewish videos, sometimes recipes he just enjoys, and even sometimes he just shares his moms brisket recipe.  One recipe of his that I really enjoy are his super simple and super quick Jelly donuts. </p>

        <p>Jake Cohen</p>
<p class = "indent">The last specific creator that I have enjoyed watching is Jake Cohen. He is another Jewish chef that gained popularity over the last couple of years and has recently come out with his own cookbook. Like Jeremy and Eitan, Jake is Jewish but does not only make or post about Jewish food. He has a whole series where he makes Tahdig, a Persian crispy rice usually with saffron and orange zest. Since seeing this series I have watched countless other videos of people making Tahdig and hope to try it soon.  Additionally, he had another series teaching how to braid challah with more than three strands. I would bake challah with my mom most weeks during high school and I watched these tutorials constantly. He has also added twists to some of the traditional Jewish foods, like challah monkey bread, and rainbow hamantaschen.
