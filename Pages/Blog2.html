  <h1>Wild Jewish Food Trends</h1>
    
     
 <p class = "indent">Over the course of the past couple of years I have seen an increase in the amount of "trendy" jewish food, or popular takes of jewish food in the media. It is not necessarily a bad thing but definitely interesting to see the takes people have on different traditional foods or the changes they make to certain foods. Here are some interesting takes that I have seen on the internet recently.</p>

           <p>Fried Pickle Challah</p>
<p class = "indent">The first is a fried pickle challah for Chanukkah. This struck me as interesting because I had never seen a pickle challah or a fried challah let alone both of them together.  The comments on this video were very mixed and some people were against this kind of challah. I can see why someone would be against this. It feels very weird and not like something that should be done. That being said, I think it was a very interesting way to make challah and I am very intrigued by the idea of a pickle challah.  I think it would actually taste very good and is something I kind of want to try.  The idea of a fried challah is less appealing to me but I still think it would be an interesting thing to try and make and eat.  Overall, I think this is a creative and definitely unique type of challah but not an abomination. </p>
