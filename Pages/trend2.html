           <p>Bagel scooped or not?</p>
<p class = "indent">Next I would like to talk about a scooped bagel. First I would like to ask the question "why?" I do not feel as positive about this as I do the challah, I am absolutely against a scooped bagel. This is a popular debate and of course everyone should eat what they want (As I type judgmentally). But scooping a bagel is just not the proper way to get the full experience out of your meal.  Most people have seen the viral Tik Tok where Taylor Offer, from LA, was denied a scooped bagel in New York. Lots of people were very upset that he would even request a scooped bagel. This brings up the many controversies surrounding bagels. I believe that the most important issue is the scooped bagel.  To accurately look at this I would like to guide you through a quick meditation. Close your eyes and slowly take some deep breaths, as you breathe in you smell the aroma of a fresh bagel wafting through your nostrils. Now, imagine you’re holding this fresh bagel, it is a little warm in your hands and you take another deep breath before going to take a bite.  You first hit the crusty surface of the bagel and then bite right into the warm doughy center, it is delicious and it feels right. Now you can see, bagels are perfect just as they are and don’t need to be scooped. Thank you.
