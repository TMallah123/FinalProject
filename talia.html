    <h2>Talia Mallah's final project</h2>
    
    <div class="center">
    <p>This website is a a culmination of some Jewish food topics that I find most interesting. It is a way for my to combine my love of food, Judaism, and coding. I have put together this website and shared some of what I find interesting about Jewish food. Overall, I found the class content to be very interesting and there is no way for me to engage with every aspect of it for the final project but these are some tidbits. </p>
    <br/>
    <p>of course this will be changed in the final draft</p>
