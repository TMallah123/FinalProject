Through engaging with the course content and doing independent research I have created and coded this website. </p>

   <p class="blue" > Throughout my first semester in college as a vegan I have realized that it not so easy to find good food. I have struggled with not being able to easily cook for myself and get food that I want to eat. I have always loved cooking, baking, and of course eating food. So, not having these things as easily accessible has become a bit of a challenge. Every Tuesday/Thursday this class was my last of the day. We would spend the class talking about food and no matter what it was I left feeling hungry and in the mood for whatever we were talking about. Though talking about the foods that I love makes me sad that I can't eat them or that they are not currently accessible, it also fills me with imense joy. I love learning about the history of the foods that I love, the foods that my grandparents make me, and the food that people of different cultures ate.  As I code this website and formulate it's contents I am sitting here with a hungry stomach and an excitement to talk about food.
